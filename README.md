### C++ foreign export implementations for the standard library

This Repository contains all foreign functions as extern C functions which
allows for using as shared objects. Not implemented functions will show up
during load time of the shared object.

Note that many values are currently missing. Only a minimum set has been implemented â€“ just beyond enough for the standard compiler tests to pass. Please feel free to contribute any that you have implemented yourself (via a pull request).
